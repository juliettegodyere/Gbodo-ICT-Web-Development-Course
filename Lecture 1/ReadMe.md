## Web development Road map.

A road map is a plan or strategy intended to achieve a particular goal.

The web development road map lays out all the basics for web development. We are going to be looking at a step-by-step strategy to take to be a web developer in the following subsections:

## The Front-End Roadmaps

## The Back-End Roadmaps

## HTTP/ WWW

## HTTP Requests/ Responses

Before we get into all that, let's first take talk about what web development is: how websites work, the difference between front and back-end, and using a code editor.

## How do websites work?

All websites, at their most basic, are just a bunch of files that are stored on a computer called a server. This server is connected to the internet. You can then load that website through a browser (like Chrome, Firefox, or Safari) on your computer or your phone. Your browser is also called the client in this situation.

So, every time that you’re on the internet, you (the client) are getting and loading data (like pictures) from the server, as well as submitting data back to the server (load more pictures!) This back and forth between the client and the server is the basis of the internet.

Anything that you can access in your browser is something that a web developer built. Some examples are small business websites and blogs on the simpler side, all the way up to very complex web apps like Facebook, InstaGram and Twitter.

## What is the difference between Front-end and Back-end?

The terms “front end,” “back end,” and “full stack” web developer describe what part of the client/server relationship you’re working with.

“Front end” means that you’re dealing mainly with the client side. It’s called the “front end” because it’s what you can see in the browser. Conversely, the “back end” is the part of the website that you can’t really see, but it handles a lot of the logic and functionality that is necessary for everything to work.

One way you can think about this is that front-end web development is like the “front of house” part of a restaurant. It’s the section where customers come to see and experience the restaurant– the interior decor, seating, and of course, eating the food.

On the other hand, back-end web development is like the “back of house” part of the restaurant. It’s where deliveries and inventory are managed, and the process to create the food all happens. There’s a lot of things behind the scenes that the customers won’t see, but they will experience (and hopefully enjoy) the end product– a delicious meal!

## HTTP/ WWW

## HTTP Requests/ Responses

This is a simple illustration of HTML, CSS and JS in action.

## Step 1:

Open the pure_html.html file with a browser of your choice to show the students how the browser will diplay the content of the HMTL document created.

## Step 2:

Open the with_css.html file to show the students how the browser will diplay the same HTML document with CSS added.

## Step 3:

Open the with_css_js.html file to show the students how the browser will diplay the same HTML document with CSS and JavaScript added.

## Step 4:

Add the link to the css file created to illustrate CSS in action. This should be added just after the <title> element

`<link rel="stylesheet" href="./assets/css/lecture1.css" />`

## Step 5:

Add the link to the javascript file created to illustrate JavaScript in action to the students. This should be added just before the closing <body> tag.

` <script src="./assets/js/lecture1.js"></script>`
