# JSON

## Step 1: Create a simple Drugs store inventory web page that has the following:

    1. A table with the following columns:
        (a) S/No
        (b) Product Name
        (c) Product Price
        (d) Purchase Date
        (e) Manufactory Date
        (f) Expiry Date
        (g) Product Quantity

    2. A form that has input fields for (b) to (g) above.

## Step 2: Declare a JSON to hold your data and add some JSON data to it.

    Hint: Your json should be an array of several objects. Each object would have key-value pairs of (a) to (g) above.

## Step 3: Add functionality to add new products to the table.

## Step 4: Ensure that the table updates when you add a new product to it.

## Step 5: Ensure that the table updates when you remove a product from it.

## Step 6: Add bootstrap to your web page and use any bootstrap class you like to beautify your page.
