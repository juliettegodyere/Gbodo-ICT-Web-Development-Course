This is a simple illustration of HTML, CSS and JS in action.

## Step 1:

Open the pure_html.html file with a browser of your choice to show the students how the browser will diplay the content of the HMTL document created.

## Step 2:

Open the with_css.html file to show the students how the browser will diplay the same HTML document with CSS added.

## Step 3:

Open the with_css_js.html file to show the students how the browser will diplay the same HTML document with CSS and JavaScript added.

## Step 4:

Add the link to the css file created to illustrate CSS in action. This should be added just after the <title> element

`<link rel="stylesheet" href="./assets/css/lecture1.css" />`

## Step 5:

Add the link to the javascript file created to illustrate JavaScript in action to the students. This should be added just before the closing <body> tag.

` <script src="./assets/js/lecture1.js"></script>`
